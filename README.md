# Cypheron

Cypheron is a secure messaging Flutter application that allows users to create encrypted messages, send them via WhatsApp, or decrypt files received through other apps. Using a custom C++ encryption algorithm integrated with Flutter's FFI, Cypheron provides secure communication channels with a focus on user privacy and ease of use.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Cypheron supports user sign-up and sign-in functionality.
- **Contact Management**: Users can manually add contacts or access their phone contacts, storing them in the app for messaging.
- **Message Encryption and Decryption**: Messages can be encrypted using a user-defined key and sent to contacts, or decrypted upon reception.
- **File Sharing Support**: Cypheron can be opened from other apps using the 'Open with' option for files with `.zk` extension.
- **Hive Database**: For efficient local storage of user data and messages.
- **Flutter FFI Integration**: Cypheronâ€™s encryption mechanism is powered by a C++ library connected through Dart FFI for seamless encryption and decryption.

## Project Structure

- **lib**: Contains the main application logic, UI screens, FFI integration, and widgets.
  - **auth**: Screens and logic for authentication (SignUp and SignIn).
  - **models**: Models like `UserModel` and `ContactModel` to manage user and contact data.
  - **services**: Contains `HiveService` for data storage and `ffi_service` for encryption/decryption functions.
  - **widgets**: Components like `ContactList` and buttons for user interaction.
- **android**: Android-specific configurations, including FFI setup and file handling for Android intents.
